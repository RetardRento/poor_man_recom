## Introduction

The recommendation system processes user posts to extract top keywords and context tags. It then finds the intersection of these tags to generate meaningful recommendations. Think of it as a matchmaker for your data, but on a budget!

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use the recommendation system, run the Jupyter notebook recom_system_upgrade.ipynb and follow the instructions provided in the cells. It's as easy as pie (or at least, as easy as pie for a data scientist)!
